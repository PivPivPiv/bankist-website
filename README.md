##Website with interactive elements on Javascript

![website](websiteDemo_;D.gif)
HTML and CSS are not mine, but all scripts I did by myself and learn:

<li>how to do sticky navigation bar with mouseover effects,
<li>how to implement lazy loading strategy for images,
<li>how to scroll the page to certain sections with buttons,
<li>how to make slider,
<li>how to reveal blocks with glide effect,
<li>and  how to use Intersection Observer API to implement all of that.
